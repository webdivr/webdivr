this mode modeules folder is automatically created in teh intial application setup. Notes are in blue book, in json section.

Setup is kinda...! create a folder for your app, create a _ folder. In there crata acomponents folder. 
go to bootstrap site, follow link to github. choose the main bootstrap download. this saves bootstrap to a folder. 

cpy js, fonts and less from bootstrap to components

in root,  crate 2 files package.json    and  gruntfile.js. both empty

next populate package.json with dependencies(look in blue book under json or copy bones from extant. 

now invoke packaage json with git. Navigate to application then do npm install. Doing this will install all the dependencies lsited by json. it does this by creating this 
nodes-modules folder then storing dependencies within. 

this stage is a milestone as you can use one dependency(grunt/uglify) to minify js. AFAICS, grunt doesnt convert less to css. we need prepos for that. 

next setup prepos to compile less to minifies css. see blackbook for notes but these are mainponts
* prepos automatically displays less files ready for compilation
* most of the listed files do not require compilation. Compile only bootstrap.less, as all teh other files in dir are imported into this daddy file.
rightlick on bootstrap.less to set a detination for the compiled css file. 

REturn to root readme now for final folder setup. 



Gruntfile setup

For us, at least at his stage of develpment, out gruntfile needs to be setup to facilitate minified js out of our compontes/js files. 

This is known as uglification.....You need the following code in yo gruntfile: 

module.exports = function(grunt) {
	grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');//afaics, this loads a component which uglifies, iow combines a bunch of js files into one, whilst minifying
	grunt.initConfig({
		

		uglify: {
    		dist: {
        		files: {
            '_/js/_bootstrap.js': ['_/components/js/jquery.js','_/components/js/affix.js','_/components/js/transition.js','_/components/js/tooltip.js','_components/js/alert.js','_/components/js/button.js','_/components/js/carousel.js','_/components/js/collapse.js','_/components/js/dropdown.js','_/components/js/modal.js','_/components/js/popover.js','_/components/js/scrollspy.js','_/components/js/tab.js'],

            '_/js/_myscript.js': '_/components/js/_myscript.js'
          
       				 }//files
   				  }//dist
		}//uglify

	})//initConfig
}//exports
