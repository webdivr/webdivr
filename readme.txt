I have put some notes in the node_modules folder to try to keep a record of setup process.  In there I outline most of the setup as I understand it. 

once you have followed those instructions, to complete initail setup of application, in root create a foler for images. call it img or images, not important.

Create 3 siblings for now extant components folder. 1 folder css, 1 folder js, 1 folder fonts.
